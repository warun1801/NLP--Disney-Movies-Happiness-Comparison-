# NLP--Disney-Movies-Happiness-Comparison

This is a NLP approach for a question which has been bugging me a lot. Which disney movies make you smile and which ones make you cry?
This is the basic topic we are going to approach

We are going to use sentiment analysis for classification of these movies based on their synopsis. Also we are going to use Topic Modelling for analysis of which topics are generakky addressed in the chosen movies.

 For Sentiment Analysis we are going to use TextBlob.
 For Topic Modelling we are going to use GenSim.
